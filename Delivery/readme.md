# Installation and Dataset

The solution is provided as a Jupyter Notebook .ipynb

The Dataset can be found directly on Kaggle Website at the following URL:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-feb-2022/data

After downloading it, create a folder **"/kaggle/input/tabular-playground-series-feb-2022/"** and place inside the two files **"train.csv"** and **"test.csv"**.


I suggest opening the notebook file directly on the Kaggle website, where it's possibile to use their dataset without downloading them.

# Libraries

The notebook uses the following libraries:

* os
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
* matplotlib.pyplot
